# ✈️ Flight Reservation System

This project focuses on developing a structured and efficient system to manage flight schedules, passenger bookings, and ticket records using Java.  
By organizing flight and passenger data systematically, the system simplifies the process of booking, modifying, and canceling reservations while maintaining accuracy and consistency.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how programming logic, data structures, and object-oriented design can be combined to develop a real-world application that models the core functionality of airline reservation systems.

## Project Overview

Airline reservation systems are essential for managing large volumes of bookings and ensuring smooth flight operations.  
This project introduces a modular Java-based framework that allows users to add new flights, make or cancel reservations, and retrieve passenger and flight details.  
It provides a structured approach to handling booking operations through the use of classes, objects, and file management.

## Objectives

- Allow users to view available flights and make reservations.  
- Store and manage flight, passenger, and booking information efficiently.  
- Enable modification and cancellation of existing bookings.  
- Display detailed flight and passenger information in an organized manner.  
- Demonstrate the use of Java’s object-oriented programming principles in building real-world systems.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Language:** Java  
- **Core Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), classes and objects, file handling, and exception management  
- **Development Environment:** Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans) or command-line compiler  
- **Input/Output:** Console-based interaction  
- **Outputs:** Flight listings, booking confirmations, and reservation summaries  

## Methodology

The system follows an object-oriented approach to divide operations into distinct modules.  
Each class handles a specific responsibility such as flight management, passenger details, or reservation handling.  
Data is stored and retrieved using file handling techniques to ensure information persistence.  
The program validates user inputs, prevents duplicate entries, and provides clear messages for each booking operation to enhance usability.

## Key Steps

1. Initialize or load available flight data.  
2. Display a list of available flights for booking.  
3. Accept passenger details and verify seat availability.  
4. Create a new reservation and generate a booking confirmation.  
5. Provide options to modify or cancel existing bookings.  
6. Update the records and save them using file handling.  
7. Display a final summary or confirmation message.  

## Recommendations

- Integrate a relational database (e.g., MySQL) for better scalability and data management.  
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing.  
- Add user authentication for passengers and administrators.  
- Implement advanced search filters for flights based on destination, price, or date.  
- Include reporting features to generate travel summaries and analytics.  

## Conclusion

The Flight Reservation System demonstrates how Java’s object-oriented features can be applied to create a robust and organized data management application.  
It highlights the importance of encapsulation, modularity, and exception handling in software development.  
Although developed for educational purposes, it lays a strong foundation for expanding into a fully functional airline management or reservation platform.
